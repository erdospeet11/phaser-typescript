This is a basic Phaser game project made with Typescript.

Idea is you have infinite dungeons (rooms joined together) and you kill monsters collect loot. everything attacks automatically, you only have to position yourself. you can collect powerups: gear, weapon, skills, attacks, gold. Special rooms or maps that are big and you encounter bigger waves.
